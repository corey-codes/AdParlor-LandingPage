# AdParlor-LandingPage

AdParlor Landing Page Case Study

- Recreation of the landing page mock up

## Changes that were made

- Alt text left empty on purely decorative images that are not links or provided no additional content value to users of assistive technology
- Increased some font sizes to meet WCAG standards on visibility and to improve contrast ratios
- Didn't us a carousel element as they can cause issues with assistive tech due to speed and functionality and they also test poorly in the majority of user experience studies
